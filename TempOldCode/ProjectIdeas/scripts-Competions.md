# Start
The script must be SFW and should be between 2-6 A4 pages.
If you press the button to start the upload process, you will be shown a form where you can upload your script, add a title, and select if you want it to be sent publicly to a channel that will be created at the end of the competition, tagged with you in it.

Once you fill out the form and have selected your script, you can press the send button. If it's successful, you will receive a message confirming that we have received your script. If not, try again or contact the moderators. 
Keep in mind you can only upload one script and cannot re-upload. So make sure you are sending the correct script.

At the end of the competition, a number of scripts will be selected, and the winners will receive a reward. The public file will be posted in #CHANNEL for people to see.
